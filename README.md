# Machine Learning Signal Processing assignments

This repository is consist of the assignments that I did for the course I took called Machine Learning for Signal processing. It has numerous algorithms developed from scratch such as Gaussian Mixture Models, PCA, Kernel PCA, Locality-sensitive hashing, KNN, Kmeans, Signal Separation, Noise reduction, Hidden Markov models, Neural Networks with back propogation, etc.
